## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that required our team to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

## Learning Goals
- Designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced ActiveRecord techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code
